# HMI Clock
## I.) Purpose of the project.
The purpose of this project is to develop a Human Machine Interaction Interface. 
Hello all. Welcome to my project of HMI Clock. The intension behind this project was to implement and demonstrate the concepts that I have learned thus far since I started on this wonderful and exciting journey of becoming a product developer.
So I thought of creating a simple machine with which any user can interact in real-time. And what other than an Alarm Clock would be a simpler machine!

Earlier when I started with this project, I was calling it an 'Alarm Clock'. But then I thought that the name itself should be self-explainatory of the intent of the project, and hence the name - 'HMI Clock'.


## II.) Scope of the Project.
The aim of this project is to develop a simple machine that will run independently on a firmware application that will be developed on STM32 nucleo board. The main objective is to create the machine interactive to users.

This project can also act as a guide to those who are learning embedded firmware development like me. It can be very helpful with learning perspective as it deals with various concepts like interrupts, I2C communication, timers, push buttonms, LCD interfacing and a few more.


## III.) Components Used
1. STM32U545 Nucleo development board.
2. Push buttons (9 in total) to interact with the clock.
3. I2C LCD to display time and information.
4. A buzzer for alarm sound.
5. Bread board, connecting wires and jumper cables.
